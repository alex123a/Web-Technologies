## Exercise: A/B Testing

In this exercise, you want to know how users engage with your album application.
To do this, you decide to try two different views for the index of the albums.
You want more people to add more albums, but also you want users to feel be impressed by the list of existing albums.

To do this, you have to cry two different views for the index of albums and show them to different users:

* The application randomly chooses which view to show to the user
* It shows the same view to the same user (*i.e., if the user reload the page, it should not change the view*) (hint: sessions!)

## Exercise: Clicker game

Remember the clicker-game example of the lecture? You have to implement this example using the two ways we explained:

1. Use a full page reload for each click
2. Update only the number of clicks
